## Description
If you're a developer then you must at some point want to collaborate with someone on a project, but it can be difficult to find the right people for the job.
Our social network application DEV-HU removes the difficulty of having to look for coding collaborators. 
This application is still in the development stages.
Here are the main features it will have:
* A User will able to sign-up and create a profile.
* Once they signup, the user will be able to login.
* Then the user will be brought to the user's page.
* The user page will display profile cards of people looking for collborators.
* The navigation bar has a Home and logout button.
* When the user is done, they can logout and log back in.

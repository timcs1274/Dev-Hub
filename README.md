# DEV-HUB

## Description

If you're a developer then you must have, at some point, wanted to find a partner to work on a project with. Our social network application Dev-Hub removes the difficulty of having to look for coding collaborators. Since this application is still in the development stages, in the meantime a user is only able to create an account. Here is a list of features we wish to add in the future to deliver on our promise of collaboration:

* Overhauled landing page
* Add user profiles
* Add support for uploadable profile pictures (Cloudinary)
* Add features for narrowing down project searches based on interests.
* The ability to favorite projects
* Searching for other users
* Ability to add friends
* Ability to delete accounts
